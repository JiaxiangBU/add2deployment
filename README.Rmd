# add2deployment

The goal of add2deployment is to
R functions for translating R to SQL for deployment.

In the early phase of modeling, the user data is not large, thus the modelers choose to deploy the model they train on Mysql or Impala.

I do such sort of things a lot and think build some defined functions to reduce the translating time (from R code to SQL-like code).

## Installation

You can install the released version of add2deployment from [Github](https://github.com/JiaxiangBU/add2deployment) with:

```{r eval=F}
devtools::install_github('JiaxiangBU/add2deployment')
```

```{r eval=F}
library(add2deployment)
```

## Example

See the vignettes.
